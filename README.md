# # React Fundamentals: `Soda Fountain` Tap Room

#### A React web application that represents a `Tap room Tracker` where a `Soda Fountain store` can track their kegs. Application lets store track the remaining amount in each Soda Keg & following are the main features of this application...

- Render list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, `Name`,  `Brand`,  `Price`  and  `Flavor`  are displayed.

-  User can submit a form to add a new keg to list.

-  User can click on a keg to see its detail page.

-  User can see how many pints are left in a keg. **PS:**  A keg is hardcoded to 15 pints for ease of use (so that one can demonstrate emptying of keg).

-  User can click a button next to a keg whenever a pint is sold. Each click will decrease the number of pints left by 1. Once pint hits 0, further reduction is prevented by disabling the button.

## Further Exploration

Additional feature built into this application are as below ..

-  Option to `edit` a keg's properties after entering them (to correct mistake).

-  Option to `delete` a keg.

-  Keg gets updated with a message `"Out of Stock"` once it's empty.

-  When pints left in a keg is under 10, keg gets updated with a message `"Almost Empty"`.
